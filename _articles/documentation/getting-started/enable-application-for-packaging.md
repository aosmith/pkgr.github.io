After you've [registered and logged in using your GitHub account][register], you should now see the welcome screen, where you will find a button to select an application for packaging.

Click on the **ADD NEW** button to start adding a new application:

The repositories that we can access will be listed, and you can now select one of them to package by clicking on the corresponding **ADD** button:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/packager-apps-new.png" />

You will then be redirected to the page where you can configure your application for packaging, as well as launch new builds, which is the subject of the next chapter.
