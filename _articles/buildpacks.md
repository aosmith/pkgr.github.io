## What's a buildpack?

{{#intro}}

The concept of buildpack was introduced by Heroku. It is a simple API to define what needs to be done to generate a self-contained version of an application, ready to be deployed. You can find more about the Buildpack API  by following [this link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api).

{{/intro}}

A buildpack has three parts:

* a detection step, where the buildpack attempts to find out whether it can process the application (e.g. the Ruby buildpack checks whether a `Gemfile` exists, among other things).

* a compilation step, where the buildpack will download dependencies, launch tasks, and generally make everything needed to "compile" the application into a self-contained artefact.

* a release step, which is used to set environment variables and various other things needed by the application to run.

## Officially supported buildpacks

Go | https://github.com/kr/heroku-buildpack-go#master

## Custom buildpacks

One of the benefits of having a well-defined buildpack API is that you can create one yourself, and use it as the source buildpack for your application. For instance, although C++ applications are not yet officially supported, you could create a buildpack that adds the necessary steps to compile the code and declare the relevant [process types][procfile].

[procfile]: ../procfile
